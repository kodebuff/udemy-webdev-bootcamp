# Boolean Logic

BOOLEAN LOGIC

Everything starts with the idea that the statement is either True or False 
Then we can combine those initial statements to create more complex statements that also evaluate to True or False

Equality Operators
  `"=="` performs type **coercion** while `"==="` does not
	coercion means trying to get the same format and compare the values
		
Logical Operators
&& AND
|| OR
! NOT

Truthy Falsy
Values that aren't actually true or false, are still inherently "truthy" or "falsy" when evaluated in boolean context
!!"hello" (is truthy)
!!"" (is falsy)

Falsy Values
false
0
""
null
undefined
NaN

Everything else is Truthy
